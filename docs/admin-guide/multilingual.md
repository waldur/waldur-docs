# Multilingual User Interface

Waldur user interface is available in several languages. Default language is English, but the end users may have several
other options to choose from. The number of available languages depends on the Waldur's configuration. Current status
of the overall avalable languages are visible on the [Localazy website](https://localazy.com/p/waldur-homeport).

Waldur uses [Localazy](https://localazy.com/) service, to translate the user interface. Localazy is a continuous
localization platform and web-based translation management system. This allows to use AI or human translation.
Everyone can contribute to Waldur's translation by adding new translantions or fixing current ones, more
information [here](https://docs.waldur.com/about/contributing/#localisation).
