### Get Celery worker statistics

Provides a comprehensive snapshot of all Celery workers' status.

This endpoint returns detailed information about:
- **active**: Tasks currently being executed by workers
- **scheduled**: Tasks scheduled for future execution (with ETA)
- **reserved**: Tasks received by workers but not yet started
- **revoked**: Task IDs that have been cancelled/revoked
- **query_task**: Results of task queries (if any)
- **stats**: Detailed worker statistics including uptime, pool info, and broker connection

Each field is a dictionary where keys are worker names (e.g., 'celery@hostname').
If no workers are available, fields will be `null`.

Requires support user permissions.
