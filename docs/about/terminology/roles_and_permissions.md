## Users, Organizations and Projects

Waldur is a service for sharing resources across projects. It is based
on the delegation model where an organization can allocate certain users to
perform technical or non-technical actions in the projects.

The most common types of Waldur installations include:

- **Cloud** - used in commercial or government sectors for providing access to cloud resources like virtual machines, storage and Kubernetes clusters.
- **Academic** - used in research and education. Waldur is deployed for a single university, high school or research infrastructure.
- **Academic Shared** - the same purpose as Academic, but is shared among several universities or infrastructures.
