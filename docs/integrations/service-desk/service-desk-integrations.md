# Service Desk integrations

Waldur supports integrations with several widely used service desk solutions. Integration allows creation of
support requests directly from Waldur. In addition, replies from the support personnel are synchronised with
Waldur so that the end users are never directly exposed to the service desk software. Users can see the
issues' history, current status of active tickets as well as are able to interact with tickets
from within Waldur.

Currently supported service desk solutions:

- [Atlassian ServiceDesk](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management) (on-prem and cloud);
- [Zammad](https://zammad.com/en);
- [Microfocus SMAX](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/smax/predictable-it-service-management).
