# Terminology policy

We prefer British English over American English. For example, we use `cancelled` instead of `canceled`.

Should be applied for naming buttons, separate pages of the process and in list of actions.

**Add** / **Remove**

Should be used when an action of creating/adding or deleting/removing is
applied to:

* Organizations
* Projects
* Providers
* VMs
* Applications
* SLA
* SSH key
* Team members

**Import** / **Unlink**

Should be used when an action of importing or unlinking / deleting a record without
undeploying is applied to:

* VMs

Please use "synchronise" instead of "pull" in action title.
