# Tasks and executors

## Scheduling Celery task from signal handler

Please use transaction.on_commit wrapper if you need to schedule Celery task from signal handler.
Otherwise, Celery task is scheduled too early and executed even if object is not yet saved to the database.

## Executors

Waldur performs logical operations using executors that combine several tasks.

Executor represents a logical operation on a backend, like VM creation or resize.
It executes one or more background tasks and takes care of resource state updates
and exception handling.

## Tasks

There are 3 types of task queues: regular (used by default), heavy and background.

## Task registration

For class based tasks use old Task base class for compatibility:

```python
  from celery import Task
```

For functions use decorator shared_task:

```python
  from celery import shared_task


  @shared_task
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y
```

### Regular tasks

Each regular task corresponds to a particular granular action - like state transition,
object deletion or backend method execution. They are supposed to be combined and
called in executors. It is not allowed to schedule tasks directly from
views or serializer.

### Heavy tasks

If task takes too long to complete, you should try to break it down into smaller regular tasks
in order to avoid flooding general queue. Only if backend does not allow to do so,
you should mark such tasks as heavy so that they use separate queue.

```python
  @shared_task(is_heavy_task=True)
  def heavy(uuid=0):
    print('** Heavy %s' % uuid)
```

### Throttle tasks

Some backends don't allow to execute several operations concurrently within the same scope.
For example, one OpenStack settings does not support provisioning of more than 4 instances together.
In this case task throttling should be used.

### Background tasks

Tasks that are executed by celerybeat should be marked as "background".
To mark task as background you need to inherit it from core.BackgroundTask:

```python
  from waldur_core.core import tasks as core_tasks
  class MyTask(core_tasks.BackgroundTask):
    def run(self):
      print('** Background task')
```
