# How to write views

## View workflow

- **Filtering** - filter objects that are visible to a user based on his request.
  Raise 404 error if object is not visible.

- **Permissions check** - make sure that user has right to execute chosen action.
  Raise 403 error if user does not have enough permissions.

- **View validation** - check object state and make sure that selected action can be executed.
  Raise 409 error if action cannot be executed with current object state.

- **Serializer validation** - check that user's data is valid.

- **Action logic execution** - do anything that should be done to execute action.
  For example: schedule tasks with executors, run backend tasks, save data to DB.

- **Serialization and response output** - return serialized data as response.
