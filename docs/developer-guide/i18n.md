# Internationalization

Per-request internationalization is enabled by default for the following languages:

- English (en)
- Estonian (et)
- Lithuanian (lt)

Client requests will respect the `Accept-Language` header.

## Translation String Guidelines

When marking strings for translation, follow these guidelines:

- Build a proper sentence: start with a capital letter, end with a period.

  **Right:** `_('Deletion was scheduled.')`

  **Wrong:** `_('deletion was scheduled')`

- Use named-string interpolation instead of positional interpolation if message has several parameters.

  **Right:** `_('Operation was successfully scheduled for %(count)d instances: %(names)s.')`

  **Wrong:** `_('Operation was successfully scheduled for %s instances: %s.')`

- Mark the following for translation: `help_text`, `verbose_name`, exception messages, and response messages.
- Do NOT mark message templates for event or alert loggers.

## Adding New Languages

For translating fields of some models, Waldur uses [django-modeltranslation](https://django-modeltranslation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

See the [How to Add New Language](guides/how-to-add-new-language.md) guide for details on adding support for additional languages.
