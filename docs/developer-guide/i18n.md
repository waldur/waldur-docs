# Internationalization

Per-request internationalization is enabled by default for English and Estonian languages.
Client requests will respect the `Accept-Language`.

Here are the guidelines for specifying translation strings:

* Build a proper sentence: start with a capital letter, end with a period.

  **Right:** `_('Deletion was scheduled.')`

  **Wrong:** `_('deletion was scheduled')`

* Use named-string interpolation instead of positional interpolation if message has several parameters.

  **Right:** `_('Operation was successfully scheduled for %(count)d instances: %(names)s.')`

  **Wrong:** `_('Operation was successfully scheduled for %s instances: %s.')`

* help_text, verbose_name, exception message and response message should be marked,
  but don't mark message template for event or alert logger.
