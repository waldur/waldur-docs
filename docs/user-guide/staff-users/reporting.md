## HomePort reports

Waldur HomePort includes a number of built-in reports based on the user activity. Reports can be accessed by
staff and support users from the "Reporting" sidebar menu.

## Grafana and Prometheus Metrics

Waldur supports exporters to Prometheus of different statistical metrics that can be used for building
business dashboards, for example, in Grafana.

Check out details about the [setup of the exporter](../../admin-guide/grafana.md).

## Custom reports

It is possible to implement custom metric collection and report generation using Waldur SDK. Several examples are
provided in [the section for integrators](../../integrator-guide/reporting.md).
