# Impersonation functionality

Waldur provides Impersonation functionality to allow the support team to debug and resolve user-related issues more efficiently. This feature enables support users to view the user interface (UI) as though they were the user they are impersonating.

## Prerequisites

1. The impersonator must have a staff role in the Waldur deployment.
2. The user being impersonated must have an active session (users cannot be logged out).

## Process guide

1. Log in to the Waldur deployment using a staff account.
2. Navigate to the Administration menu, then go to Accounts â†’ Users from the top menu.

3. Locate the user you wish to impersonate and select Impersonate from the Actions options.

## Logging

All actions performed on behalf of a user are logged with additional context in the audit logs, including the impersonator's UUID, full name, and username. This is primarily for security purposes.
