    longDescription: >-
      Waldur is a cloud and HPC (High-Performance Computing) management platform
      designed to help service providers orchestrate and manage multi-cloud
      infrastructure. It serves as a comprehensive marketplace and resource
      management solution that bridges providers and their customers.


      Core Capabilities:

      Waldur enables service providers to consolidate resources from both
      private and public clouds into a unified platform. It supports multiple
      cloud backends including OpenStack, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, and many other
      integrations, allowing providers to offer a diverse catalog of services
      through a single interface.


      Key Features:

      Self-Service Portal: Customers access an intuitive interface for managing
      resource lifecycles, with full visibility into their infrastructure and
      operations

      API-Driven: Exposes high-level Service Provider APIs that enable
      programmatic access to the Marketplace and resource management
      functionality

      Project-Based Collaboration: Teams can invite members, delegate resource
      management, and work within project workspaces using role-based access
      controls

      Financial Management: Built-in predictive cost estimation and usage-based
      accounting provide transparency for both providers and customers

      Compliance & Monitoring: Comprehensive event tracking, alerts, and
      notifications ensure full activity monitoring and compliance

      Integrated Support: Includes helpdesk functionality with support for
      third-party helpdesk backend integration

      Analytics: Aggregates high-precision data from various sources to provide
      insights into customer behaviour

      MasterMind: The cloud orchestrator backend with REST API service and
      advanced Admin Portal for operators
